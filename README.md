Simple light-weight carousel without any libraries.
The images are from a concept artist i like, Paul Chadeisson, it's a series of images inspired from Blade runner architecture.

What i learned in this one

<ul>
    <li>Structure for a carousel</li>
    <li>the transform translate property in css</li>
    <li>a better understanding of relative and absolute positionning</li>
    <li>arial label for accessibility</li>
    <li>Keyframing animations</li>
</ul>

Could be better with 

<ul>
    <li>Adjusting the images somehow to get them to conform to the same size without cropping or deformaing the image</li>
    <li>Automated slide transitions</li>
    <li>Text on slide</li>
    <li>Indicator of wich slide is on with some visual cues like points on the bottom</li>
</ul>
